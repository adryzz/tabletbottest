So I have a girlfriend with rather large and sizable breasts. They are not only large, but also naturally firm and don’t droop too much. Perfect proportions for online art enthusiasts.

Being a crypto man, I suggested that we take many nude photographs of her bodacious breasts and mint them. And then, after covering them in peppermint oil, turn them into NFTs.

Now I’ve heard that NFTs are selling for thousands and even millions of dollars worth of Ethereum. So my question is: will her big breast NFTs make me a millionaire, so that I don’t have to waste time working at Wendy’s anymore?
